##  Properties of G++ Language:
G++ is a Gebze Technical University programming language with:

 - Lisp like syntax
 - Imperative, non-object oriented
 - Static scope, static binding, strongly typed, â€¦
 - **Keywords**:
	 -  `and, or, not, equal, append, concat, set, deffun, for, while, if, exit`
 - **Operators**:
	 -  `+, -, /, *, (, ), **`
 - **Terminals:**
	 - `Keywords`
	 - `Operators`
	 - `0-9`
	 - `BinaryValue  -> True | False`
	 - `IntegerValue -> [-]*[1-9]*[0-9]+`
	 - `Id 		  -> [a-zA-Z]+`
	

## Lexer

Lexer written in CommonLisp.

Given the description of the G++ language that is shown above the lexer implemented does tokenization of a given G++ program. The program is given in a file.

To test the code you need to call function lexer("filename.txt") which takes as a parameter a file that contains program with G++ syntax.

After the lexical analysis is performed the output is the tokens of the program.

**Token Names:**

 - INTEGER
 - BINARY
 - KEYWORD
 - OPERATOR

**Usage:**
```sh
$ lexer(filename.gpp)
```
